    <p>In 2020, sales from bookstores reached their lowest value in over ten years. This was mostly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which motivated people to buy books online to avoid going outside. However, the low revenue
    should not be exclusively attributed to these circumstances, as the low sales fall in line with a steady years-long decline. </p>

    <p> The following chart uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau on bookstore revenue since 2008 and data from the Association of American Publishers on general revenue from the book publishing industry:</p>

<p> When asked about what bookstores could do to prevent this, John McKay, Senior Vice President of Communications at the Association of American Publishers, said: “I think that it’s not just up to bookstores, but up to book-lovers as well. […] Whenever I go into a new city, I always look for a bookstore to visit. People have to make a choice to support their local bookstores.”</p>
